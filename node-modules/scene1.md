write some words all over again
typing some word and not being noisy or anything

the totoal s why did that happen I wonder, doesn't reallly make much sense, if you know what I mean. some words so we can get some precentage point up on teh session count .

the two characters seem locked in sync wich seems to be teh sessions value 
which is a bit unfortunate dkja
they are stull working word and stuff.  It's not counting which is good.  we added this 237 words

some words to get us a bar.  not sure how many words wee need for that.... looks like 12 hy  h x So we write some words at 1am like an idion and why am I doing it needing 12 per sliver instead of doing at 1 per sliver?n  cause I'm dumb.. 

Some scene words that is awsome and all lets see 100 words devided by 25 I think.... so I shold get a tick ever 40 words or there about no t sure what the exact number is but it should be coming soon I'd think there was one earlier, stilll it's can't be long but maybe it is what do I know it certainly isnt popping right away ot anything.  it's bben 70 words and I only saw one tick pop  though I did get one on the manuscript for hitting 2.7 pereent or something.  there i went..
